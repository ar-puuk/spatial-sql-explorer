# Specification Quality Checklist: Raster view and inspect

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — the spec names no library; reader candidates live in research.md
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (FR-015, Assumptions list what is out)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Constitution amendment (raster VIEW in scope; raster is the open layer and replaces vector; raster engine download) is a plan-phase task, not a spec gap.
- The striped-file size limit, the style sidecar format and the `.tif` editor priority are deliberately left to the plan, after the spikes in research.md.
