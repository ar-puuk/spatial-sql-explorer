# Changelog

All notable changes to Spatial Explorer are documented here. The VS Code
extension and the web app share one engine (`packages/core`, `packages/ui`)
and are versioned together. The pre-rebuild single-page app is tagged
`legacy-v1`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Quick Look (spec 001).** Open a vector file and see it on a map and in an
  attribute table, in VS Code (custom editor) and in the web app (file
  picker or drag and drop). Formats: GeoJSON, GeoPackage, FlatGeobuf,
  Shapefile (with sidecars), GeoParquet, Parquet with a WKB column, GML, and
  CSV with `lon`/`lat`, `longitude`/`latitude` or `wkt` columns.
- **CRS handling.**
  - The source CRS is read from the file and the layer is reprojected to WGS84
    for display; the status bar reports the original CRS.
  - Files without a CRS are disclosed as "WGS84 assumed".
- **Basemaps.**
  - OpenFreeMap basemaps (Positron, Liberty, Bright, Dark, Fiord), with
    previews in the picker.
  - The default follows the light/dark theme, including theme changes while
    the viewer is open.
  - Blank background whose color can be customized; the choice is remembered.
  - If a basemap fails to load, the map falls back to blank and shows a short
    message; the data is unaffected.
- **Attribute table.**
  - A resizable, collapsible drawer under the map.
  - Fast with large files: only visible rows are rendered.
  - Sortable, resizable columns, with a header that stays in place while
    scrolling.
  - Keyboard navigation.
  - Selection stays in sync with the map; double-click a row to zoom to it.
- **Map.**
  - Zoom, fit-to-layer, layer style and basemap controls, plus a scale bar.
  - Clicking a feature selects it and opens a feature inspector listing all
    of its attributes.
- **Layer styles.**
  - Fill, outline, width and point size.
  - Saved as a QGIS `.qml` sidecar next to the data. QGIS loads it too, and
    it is applied automatically on open.
  - Export and import as QGIS QML, OGC SLD, or Mapbox GL style JSON.
- **VS Code integration.**
  - Native look under every color theme, including high contrast.
  - Native status bar items: CRS, feature count, cursor coordinates.
  - "Open in Spatial Explorer" in the Explorer and editor-tab context menus.
  - A "Spatial Explorer" output channel with per-open timings.
  - A notice, with Reload, when the open file changes on disk.
- **Web app.** Branded header, drop zone, and a status bar docked to the map;
  light and dark follow the OS.
- **Developer tooling.** `npm run screenshots` captures the real VS Code
  extension (three themes) and the web app (light and dark).

### Performance

- About 10 MB opens in ~1.2 s with the engine already started. DuckDB starts
  in the background (pre-warm) and is reused between opens. Each file is
  parsed once, then its memory is released.

- At most 1,000 features are drawn at a time. Feature counts and the map
  extent always cover the whole file.
